 *  - This object is active via setActive() (typically if the settings page is visible.)
 *  - The account is connected.
 *  - Every 30 seconds (defaultIntervalT) or 5 seconds in case of failure (failIntervalT)

 * We only request the quota when the UI is visible otherwise this might slow down the server with

 * quota is not updated fast enough when changed on the server.

 * If the quota job is not finished within 30 seconds, it is cancelled and another one is started
