t1 - an integration test script for csync syncing to ownCloud.

Note: This test script uses perl HTTP::DAV. This package needs to
be in version 0.47 at least. Many distros deliver older versions.

t1 uses a perl WebDAV client lib to sync to an existing instance of
ownCloud. For that, various files are copied around, synced and the
results are tested through their existance, the filesize and the 
modification times. All tests are asserts, which means that the 
scripts stops if a test fails.

How to call:

First, configure the script. For that, create a file t1.cfg. There
is t1.cfg.in as an example. Yeah, this test script is not secure,
make sure to run it with a weak account and in a save environment.

To start the script, call ./t1.pl on the commandline. A lot of 
output is generated. If the script does not fail, everything works.

Before it actually ends, it takes a four seconds break for you to 
interrupt with Ctrl-C. If you don't do that, it removes all its 
traces...

If SSL should be used, SSL must be available to LWP connections. To
disable host checking for crappy SSL certs, do
export PERL_LWP_SSL_VERIFY_HOSTNAME=0

Have fun,
