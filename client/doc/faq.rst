**Issue:**

Some files are continuously uploaded to the server, even when they are not modified.

**Resolution:**

It is possible that another program is changing the modification date of the file.

If the file is uses the ``.eml`` extension, Windows automatically and
continually changes all files, unless you remove
``\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\PropertySystem\PropertyHandlers``
from the windows registry.
